           <p>Penney's game, named after its inventor Walter Penney, is a binary sequence generating game between two players.
               Player A selects a sequence of heads and tails of length 3 and then Player B also selects a sequence of heads and tails of length 3.
               Then a fair coin is tossed until either player A's or player B's sequence appears as a consecutive subsequence of the coin toss outcomes.
               The player whose sequence appears first wins.
           </p>
            <p>You can now start the game on the left hand side by selecting the sequence of which you think has the best chance to win.
                When click on the "Click to Initiate Gamers", another sequence will be generated by the computer. The odds of each player winning the game
                can then be viewed by clicking the "Click to Check the Odds" button. You can also start a round of the game by click the
                "Click to Generate 1 Round Game", a series of coin tosses will be simulated until the last three outcomes match with one of the player's choice.
                Play the game several times to check if the game outcome matches the theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are eight sequences can be chosen in total. By choosing each of them, you can see that there is always a sequence chosen by the computer
                that can beat the player's choice. This is because Penney's game is a non-transitive game. There is NO best options in such a game. Given a sequence,
                one can always find another sequence that has a higher chance of occuring first. A similar game is known as "Rock Paper Scissors".
